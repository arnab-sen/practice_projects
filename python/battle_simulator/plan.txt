TODO:
- Make moves into buttons -> pressing move makes e.g. "current_move = move_1"
- Incorporate battle_simulator.py logic:
	- Fighter class --> Pokemon class
	- Each pokemon is assigned the sprite (get a dict of {national dex no. : pokemon name} e.g. "001" : "Bulbasaur")
	- Scrape move lists from serebii
